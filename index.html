            <h1>Hi There</h1>
            <h2>Hope you read this</h2>
            <p>I am the sun
                I am the brightest thing in this space
                And I fell in love with a beautiful star from a dangerous place
                But, how can I reach you?
                If the asteroids around you are blocking my way in having you</p>
            <p>
                I can call myself as the sun - probably hot and bright 
                Radiant positivity is all that I can provide 
                I can make any black hole into a bright galaxy 
                And I can make love explode like the Big Bang Theory
                But, is that feature enough to call you my one and only?</p>
            <p>I got my eyes on you, the brightest star in the night sky
                Sirius? Betelgeuse? Arcturus? No, you're brighter than them
                Even NASA can't determine how bright you are 
                That's why, I can't have you 
                That's why, I can't go near you
                And that's why, I can't be with you 
                Because, you're too bright to have and too hard to love</p>
            <p>You know why I can't have you?
                I'm not talking about my light in comparison to yours
                Well, we're just not compatible 
                Your type is the opposite of me and my whole self- the other
                </p>
            <p>And then there's Altair 
                Totally my opposite and totally your type 
                You even do childish things with Altair, like growing your own stars
                So, here I am, watching you smile from afar 
                But, I don't really care - just kidding 
                I really wish I were Altair</p>
            <p>If you would give me a chance 
                I would do crazy things just to have you
                I would steal Saturn's ring and put it in your finger 
                I would protect you, if the universe is in danger
                </p>
            <p>In the universe, there are billions of stars
                And I fell in love with you 
                A star I can't reach and a star I can't have 
                But, watching you with Altair, it makes me sob
                Because this is not what I wish for in the heavens above</p>
            <p>You are so far 
                Very, very far
                It really is hard, falling in love with a distant star</p>
